# Bank Management System

## Overview

This C++ project is a comprehensive Bank Management System designed with an object-oriented approach. It provides a robust framework for managing customers, accounts, transactions, and various banking services. The system is developed to handle essential banking operations, offering features that encompass customer and account management, transaction handling, and a range of banking services.

## Features

1. **Customer Management:**

   - Create, update, and delete customer records.
   - Retrieve and display customer details, including personal information.

2. **Account Management:**

   - Add, modify, and close bank accounts for customers.
   - Display account information, such as account balance and account holder details.

3. **Transaction Handling:**

   - Record and manage transactions, including withdrawals, deposits, and transfers.
   - View transaction history for each account.

4. **Banking Services:**

   - Allow customers to perform withdrawals, deposits, and fund transfers between accounts.
   - Provide real-time updates on account balances and transaction statuses.

5. **Object-Oriented Design:**
   - Utilizes C++'s object-oriented programming features to organize code into classes for customers, accounts, and transactions.
   - Encapsulates data and behavior within classes for a modular and maintainable codebase.

## Technologies Required

- **C++ Programming Language:**

  - Utilizes C++ for its flexibility, performance, and object-oriented capabilities.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS):**

  - Leverages the principles of OOP to structure the code, promoting code reuse, modularity, and maintainability.

- **MySQL Database:**
  - Integrates with MySQL to store and retrieve customer, account, and transaction data.
  - Enables seamless interaction between the C++ application and the database.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank-management-system.git`
2. Compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler.
3. Ensure MySQL is installed and configure database connection parameters in the source code.
4. Run the compiled executable to start the Bank Management System.
