# TextEditor

## Project Overview

Build a simple text editor in C++ that allows users to create, edit, and save text files. This project aims to provide a basic understanding of graphical user interfaces (GUI) and file handling in C++.

## Features

### 1. User Interface

- Basic GUI using [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) or [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
- Text area for user input.
- Menus for file operations (New, Open, Save, Save As, Exit).
- Display current file name and editing status.

### 2. File Operations

- **New:** Create a new, empty file.
- **Open:** Load an existing text file into the editor.
- **Save:** Save the current file (if it has a name) or prompt the user to choose a location.
- **Save As:** Save the current file with a new name.

### 3. Text Editing

- Allow users to type and edit text within the editor.
- Basic text editing functionalities: copy, cut, paste, undo, and redo.

### 4. Search and Replace

- Search for a specific word or phrase within the text.
- Replace occurrences of a word or phrase.

### 5. Syntax Highlighting (Optional)

- Basic syntax highlighting for common programming languages.
- Highlight keywords, comments, and strings differently.

### 6. Keyboard Shortcuts

- Provide keyboard shortcuts for common operations (e.g., Ctrl+S for save, Ctrl+C for copy).

### 7. Status Bar

- Display a status bar at the bottom with line number, column number, and editing mode information.

## Project Steps

1. **Environment Setup:**

   - Set up your C++ development environment.
   - Choose a GUI library (Qt or SFML) and integrate it into your project.

2. **Create Basic UI:**

   - Design the main window with a text area and menu bar.
   - Implement the file menu with options for New, Open, Save, Save As, and Exit.

3. **Text Editing Functionality:**

   - Implement the core functionality for text input, copy, cut, paste, undo, and redo.

4. **File Operations:**

   - Implement file-related functionalities: New, Open, Save, and Save As.

5. **Search and Replace:**

   - Add a search bar and functionality for searching and replacing text.

6. **Syntax Highlighting (Optional):**

   - If interested, add syntax highlighting features.

7. **Keyboard Shortcuts:**

   - Assign keyboard shortcuts to common operations for a smoother user experience.

8. **Status Bar:**

   - Implement a status bar at the bottom of the window to display relevant information.

9. **Testing:**

   - Test your text editor with various scenarios, ensuring all features work as expected.

10. **Documentation and Refinement:**
    - Document your code and provide clear comments.
    - Refine the user interface and user experience based on testing and feedback.
